                        <p>Monica: I would get a room with this cake. I think

                        <p>Phoebe: If you had to, what would you give up, food

                        <p>Monica: (with no hesitation) Sex!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she 
                          said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex 
                          with you"!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.</p>

                          sex or food?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Food.</p>

                        <p>Ross: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you 
                          give up, sex or food?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, you gotta pick one!</p>

                          Rachel: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, how cute!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! 
                          (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. 
                          (he's on the street, talking to a woman)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: OH! He's having an affair.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: He's not having an affair!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You know, I'm always right about these things.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross 
                          was trying to kill you!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that 
                          anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! 
                          (looking outside) See, there's something going on with 
                          them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile 
                          phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. 
                          Phoebe calls Chandler) </p>
                        <p>Chandler: (picking up the phone) Hello.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know 
                          that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) 
                          ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies 
                          with me and Rachel.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm 
                          stuck at the office all day.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that 
                          you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, 
                          either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", 
                          or... "An Affair To Remember".</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Those are all really old!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (whispering) "Dude, Where's My Car?" 
                        </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (glancing at her) What?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: They're in a caaar...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk 
                          to you later. Okay, bye. </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Geez!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision 
                          goggles and my stun gun.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (patting her bag) I got them!</p>
                        <p>[Scene: Monica’s apartment. Chandler enters the 
                          door.]<br>
                          Chandler: Hi!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Chandler: I was in the car with Nancy all day.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Nancy doesn’t smoke!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be 
                          thankful for that!</p>
                        <p>Monica: So? What do you think of the house?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: It’s perfect. It’s everything 
                          we’ve been looking for.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing 
                          wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows 
                          in the attic? </p>
                        <p>Chandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? 
                          (pause) What were the things you said?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Don’t you love the huge yard?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom.</p>
                        <p>Monica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, 
                          because the guy lost his job and has to move in with 
                          his parents!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!</p>
                        <p>Monica: So? Do you think we should get it?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I don’t know. What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Monica: I think we should.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I do too.</p>
                        <p>Monica: This is huge!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know.</p>
                        <p>Monica: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking 
                          cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was 
                          getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, 
                          I was at work all day.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We don’t. Not until it's a hundred 
                          percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so 
                          hard.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it.</p>

                          and Chandler is there.]<br>
                          Ross: I just can’t see Chandler cheating!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I’m telling you guys, we followed them 
                          out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like 
                          forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty 
                          happy!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something 
                          is not right. I just can’t believe he would do 
                          this to Monica!</p>
                        <p>Ross: I know, and with the baby coming?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So, should we tell her?</p>
                        <p>Ross: I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw 
                          Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Why? Who’d you seen him with?</p>
                        <p>Ross: No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts 
                          pinching him in his neck)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!</p>
                        <p>Ross: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s 
                          a great guy, it was hypothetical!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: All right. (she releases him). He is a good 
                          guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s 
                          no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)</p>

                        <p>Chandler: Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm 
                          not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Why do you have a realtor?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside 
                          of the city.</p>

                        <p>Rachel: Are you serious?</p>
                        <p>Monica: When we found out that we're gonna get this 
                          baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided 
                          that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So you're gonna move?</p>

                          I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker 
                          is doing it!</p>
                        <p>Monica: And that's great for you guys, but we want 
                          a lawn and a swingset...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their 
                          bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving 
                          up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want 
                          Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as 
                          soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your 
                          door?</p>
                        <p>Ross: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, 
                          that's okay.</p>
                        <p>Joey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) 
                          I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)</p>
                        <p>Ross: (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it 
                          out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but 
                          you're going to realize, this is the only place, you 
                          wanna be.</p>
                        <p>(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look 
                          like they are looking for the right words)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Actually, we already found a house we love.</p>
                        <p>Ross: What?</p>
                        <p>Monica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.</p>
                        <p>(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There 
                          is a long silence.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, 
                          huh?</p>
                        <p>TIME LAPSE</p>
                        <p>Ross: You put an offer on a house? </p>
                        <p>Monica: (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has 
                          this big yard that leads down to this stream and then 
                          there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? 
                          Beavers?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know this is really hard and we're really 
                          sorry.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Is this because I come over here without knocking 
                          and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because 
                          I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, 
                          really think I can! </p>
                        <p>Chandler: (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the 
                          reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something 
                          from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back 
                          to where he was standing before)</p>
                        <p>Monica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I 
                          mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) 
                          It is beautiful, isn't it?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah it is.</p>
                        <p>Joey: What the hell are you doin'?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there 
                          today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler

                          a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What 
                          if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a 
                          purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you 
                          to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor,

                          the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, 
                          but for me, this has been really great, you know, I 
                          think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile 
                          vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd 
                          gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, 
                          if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be 
                          all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to 
                          say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings 
                          sucked.</p>
                        <p>All: That's so sweet.</p>
                        <p>Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: And a crappy New Year.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Here, here!</p>
                        <p>[Scene: We're back to the present. Chandler and Monica's. 
                          They're all still at the kitchen table.]<br>
                          Rachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. 
                          That's like the worst of the Chesters.</p>
                        <p>Ross: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, 
                          I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner 
                          or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel 
                          better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? 
                          The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so 
                          good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... 
                          (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.</p>
                        <p>(The phone rings and Chandler goes to get it)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our 
                          offer.</p>
                        <p>Monica: And?</p>
                        <p>(Chandler listens to what Nancy says)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They 
                          passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the 
                          asking price.</p>
                        <p>Monica: We can't afford that.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, there you go.</p>
                        <p>(Chandler and Monica hug)</p>
                        <p>Joey: I'm really sorry you guys.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that 
                          that phone call didn't come before I told you about 
                          looking through the window.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (to Monica) You're gonna be okay?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, we'll be okay.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel 
                          and Phoebe leave.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive 
                          before.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That's okay, we understand.</p>
                        <p>Joey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping 
                          with her, should I?</p>
                        <p>(Chandler gives Joey her business card, which he eagerly 
                          grabs and he leaves.)</p>
                        <p>Monica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just 
                          so... I love that one so much.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it 
                          then.</p>
                        <p>Monica: What?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We got the house.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I just didn't want to tell you in front of 
                          them.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house!?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We're getting the house. (they hug) We're 
                          getting the house.</p>
                        <p>Monica: And a baby...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We're growing up.</p>
                        <p>Monica: We sure are.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: So who's gonna tell them?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (quickly) Not it!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Not it! Damn it!</p>
                        <p>COMMERCIAL BREAK<br>
                          [Scene: Central Perk. The entire gang is there, and 
                          Chandler and Monica are handing out presents.]<br>
                          Monica: Rachel, this is yours.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You'll see.</p>
                        <p>Monica: All right, everybody open them!</p>
                        <p>(they all tear off the wrapping paper)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got 
                          a scarf)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in 
                          the store. (she got earrings)</p>
                        <p>Monica: I know.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I love this. (he got a sweater)</p>
                        <p>Joey: A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are 
                          these for?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, 
                          but... We got the house.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Enjoy!</p>
                        <p>(they both run off, leaving Ross, Phoebe and Rachel 
                          stunned.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) 
                          What did they say?</p>
                        <p>THE END</p>
