                        <p>Monica: (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, 
                          a sunken ship.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're

                        <p>Monica: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette

                          alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny

                        <p>Chandler: Who?</p>

                        <p>Chandler: (looking around) Did I go to this school?</p>

                        <p>Chandler: (looks over at her) Sure, nice.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Dude. You're married to my sister.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You're right, by saying "nice" 
                          I'm virtually licking her.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I 
                          should ask her out?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Are you asking permission to break the pact?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yes please.</p>

                          corridor. Ross is hanging some flyers on the wall. Both 
                          have a funny 80s hair and clothes.]<br>
                          Ross: Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I 
                          made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Awesome, the name really stands out.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica 
                          Bold 24 point"!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student 
                          union!</p>
                        <p>Missy: Hey guys!</p>

                        <p>Chandler: You know, our band is playing on Friday.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're 
                          called "Way! No Way!".</p>
                        <p>Missy: No way!</p>
                        <p>Chandler and Ross: Way!</p>
                        <p>Missy: Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)</p>

                        <p>Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have 
                          is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, 
                          we can get laid anytime we want.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school...</p>
                        <p>Ross: Me too. I'm good at it.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither 
                          of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.</p>
                        <p>Ross: You got it.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe 
                          Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out 
                          with.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Those are the pacts!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't 
                          get her anyway.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, oh... maybe not you!</p>

                          I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up 
                          to girls in college?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Your hands are shaking.</p>

                          bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and

                          pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug 
                          in his cd player) Here? All right.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Rachel?</p>

                          a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the 
                          first name we could find!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: How old is your phonebook?</p>

                          and half scared. He takes his hat off and throws it 
                          away, does some "Can Can" high kicks and swings 
                          his butt in front of Phoebe who looks at it in disgust. 
                          Then he tears open his shirt and shows her his chest 
                          and she flinches.)</p>

                          need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to 
                          get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long 
                          time!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Shocking!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do 
                          anything!</p>
                        <p>Roy: Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from 
                          Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... 
                          It's not like I can take them two at a time!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars 
                          for this.</p>
                        <p>Roy: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight 
                          to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why 
                          I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around 
                          in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! 
                          (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they

                          ... is all man.</p>

                        <p>Ross: (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm 
                          sorry.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong 
                          time ago.</p>
                        <p>Ross: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made 
                          out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..</p>
                        <p>Ross: We are even, right?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed 
                          at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. 
                          So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did 
                          you do to my mom?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Not her!</p>

                        <p>Monica: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers

                        <p>Chandler: Well maybe if you go to school here next 
                          year we can totally hang out.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't

                          important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so 
                          I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She 
                          pulls away) Hey!</p>

                          have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What 
                          am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty

                        <p>Roy: I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I 
                          can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can 
                          go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.</p>

                        <p>Roy: You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can 
                          do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would

                          our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. 
                          She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. 
                          Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. 
                          But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started 
                          to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. 
                          It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And 
                          now, now I find out that you kissed her first.</p>

                        <p>Chandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her 
                          on your bed?</p>
