                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to 
                          get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding 
                          tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently 
                          stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait 
                          till Monday.</p>
                        <p>Joey: So he can't come?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the 
                          aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you 
                          would do it.</p>

                          a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked 
                          out for me and shared your wisdom...</p>
                        <p>Joey: I am pretty wisdomous.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So... what do you say?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.

                        <p>Joey: (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... 
                          (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your

                          Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, 
                          so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't 
                          matter to me! </p>
                        <p>Monica: (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking

                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I don't care, so you pick!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) 
                          All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner 
                          tonight at 1800 hours.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.</p>
                        <p>Monica: You don't know military time?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Why, I must have been in missile training the 
                          day they taught that.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Just subtract twelve.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, 
                          seven hundred and...</p>
                        <p>Monica: (screaming) Six o'clock!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller 
                          here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. 
                          (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I 
                          told you I just want a simple wedding.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now 
                          I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, 
                          ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing 
                          the steel drums.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ooh... she backed out.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: She did? Why?</p>
                        <p>Monica: I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums 
                          don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does 
                          Marjorie's overwhelming scent.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet 
                          is free.</p>

                          Chandler: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You look great. I'm so glad we're having 
                          this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to 
                          practice my meals before I eat them. </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to 
                          us?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the 
                          actual wedding.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Rehearse it!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)</p>
                        <p>Mike: Thanks for coming you guys.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands 
                          but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going 
                          for a hand shake.</p>
                        <p>Mike: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?</p>
                        <p>Ross: That is why!</p>
                        <p>Mike: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So Rach.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Where is Emma?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. 
                          Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.</p>
                        <p>Monica: (coming) Are you still crying about your damn 
                          baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 
                          20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the 
                          time! (she takes off)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?</p>
                        <p>Mike's mother: Yes, we are.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?</p>
                        <p>Mike's father: How's that?</p>
                        <p>Joey: You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, 
                          but on the other hand it's hard to let go.</p>
                        <p>Mike's father: Who in God's name are you?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? 
                          But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!</p>
                        <p>(Cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? 
                          We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't 
                          they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to 
                          be their bridesmaid?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Uh... November?</p>
                        <p>Ross: I wanna say it's not looking good.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Hey Pheebs...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What's up?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're 
                          doing in the wedding yet.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Heh.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.</p>
                        <p>Ross: What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, 
                          so there's an embarrassing long pause)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, this is really awkward (staring at the 
                          floor) Oh, and I can leave!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got 
                          his brother and his friends from school so... you know, 
                          you were, you were... if it helps you, you were next 
                          in line, you just, you just missed the cut.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, man!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: This is like figure skating team all over 
                          again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean 
                          synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- 
                          I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!</p>
                        <p>Ross: FOOTBALL!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>Monica: (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, 
                          spit that out, that has pork in it.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed 
                          to be vegetarian!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, I changed them. I, I sent you a fax about 
                          it!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I don't have a fax machine.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!</p>
                        <p>Ross: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people 
                          that aren't in this wedding.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.</p>
                        <p>Ross: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not 
                          in it...</p>
                        <p>Mike: Hey guys, how is it going?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing 
                          nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Mike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question 
                          for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had 
                          had an emergency and can't make it.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: What happened?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Who cares, AND?</p>
                        <p>Mike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe 
                          one of you guys... </p>
                        <p>Ross: (stands up) I'll do it!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (standing up too) M-Me, me, me!</p>
                        <p>Mike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room 
                          for one.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will 
                          not steal focus.</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... 
                          watch! (he mimics the groomsmen's way of walking down 
                          the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?</p>
                        <p>Mike: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable 
                          making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, 
                          I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)</p>
                        <p>Ross: (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then 
                          say hello to Mike's next groomsman.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as 
                          he is me!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Please, you're going down!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You are going downer!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't 
                          make it! (they hug)</p>

                          serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?</p>
                        <p>Mike: I intend to marry her.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, 
                          no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by 
                          playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?</p>
                        <p>Mike: No more so than acting.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Strike two!</p>
                        <p>Mike: You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, 
                          unless we move in with you, dad?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: I decided to pee.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose 
                          one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen 
                          fell out.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two!

                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking 
                          by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special 
                          bridesmaid task for you today.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of 
                          her face) Goody, what is it!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman 
                          and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So 
                          good luck with that.</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new 
                          bridesmaid.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'll do it! (Monica approaches)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your 
                          toast. (Mike appears)</p>
                        <p>Mike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?</p>
                        <p>Monica: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your 
                          own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard 
                          to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing 
                          kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You 
                          just get in, do your thing and get out!</p>
                        <p>Mike: Is that what you say to Chandler?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. 
                          (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd 
                          like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being 
                          here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of 
                          you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to 
                          the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and 
                          I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... 
                          (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe 
                          speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot 
                          of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen 
                          who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping 
                          her watch with her finger) it's not important... she 
                          is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing 
                          me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend 
                          Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica 
                          clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... 
                          it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my 
                          mother, who couldn't be here...</p>

                          all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but 
                          she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. 
                          I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping 
                          half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to 
                          know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica 
                          is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T 
                          DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT 
                          THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) 
                          OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) 
                          OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE 
                          CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You 
                          know what? You're done.</p>
                        <p>Monica: What?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause 
                          and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, 
                          smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his 
                          glass.)</p>

                          and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to 
                          move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for 
                          the corsages.</p>

                        <p>Monica: Hi. About last night... I know you are under 
                          a lot of stress and even though the things you said 
                          hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing 
                          to take my job back.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will 
                          do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you 
                          want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't 
                          really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if 
                          you're taking over, you should probably return these 
                          messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages 
                          and calls to return)</p>

                        <p>Monica: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I 
                          mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, 
                          but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You won awards?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.</p>

                        <p>Monica: She's in her room, why?</p>
                        <p>Ross: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, 
                          ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm 
                          sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's 
                          room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake

                        <p>Ross: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman 
                          yet, have you?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder 
                          than it already is!</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, Chandler said that it's really important 
                          to him too!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk 
                          down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say 
                          a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering 
                          stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!</p>

                          that be?</p>

                          towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type 
                          voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... 
                          and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) 
                          I cannot allow this. </p>

                          bad mafia movie?</p>

                          few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family 
                          Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal." </p>

                          you want?</p>

                          that you are gonna take care of her.</p>
                        <p>Mike: (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single 
                          most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let

                          to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna 
                          be family, and there is nothing more important in the

                          just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some 
                          comedy!</p>

                          Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when 
                          I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you 
                          know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, 
                          I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big 
                          fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules 
                          to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then 
                          run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of 
                          this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are 
                          gonna come rushing back. </p>

                          which one of you guys to pick. </p>
                        <p>Mike: Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I 
                          had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third 
                          groomsman was my family dog. Chappy. </p>
                        <p>Ross: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. </p>
                        <p>(all eyes turn to Rachel) </p>
                        <p>Rachel: (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think 
                          I'm gonna have to go with the dog.</p>
                        <p>(Ross and Chandler look shocked)</p>
                        <p>(Cut to Phoebe who is in the living room, still on 
                          the phone.)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that 
                          the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not 
                          and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? 
                          Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? </p>
                        <p>Monica: (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going? 
                        </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (to Monica) Help me.</p>
                        <p>Monica: What? </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again. </p>
                        <p>Monica: (Sounds moved) Really? </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (Nearly in tears) Please? </p>
                        <p>Monica: You really want me to come back?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: More than I wanna get married.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her 
                          headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo 
                          much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get 
                          your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.</p>
                        <p>(Joey walks in) </p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (sounds scared already) About what?</p>
                        <p>Joey: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like 
                          the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed 
                          all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to 
                          reveal a snow storm outside)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are 
                          coming all the way in from New Jersey!</p>
                        <p>Joey: I don't think they are.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going 
                          to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry 
                          Pheebs. </p>
                        <p>[Scene: Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.]<br>
                          Monica: (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost 
                          it's power.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah according to the news, most of the city 
                          did.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Since when do you watch the news? </p>
                        <p>Joey: Uh, for your information, since they hired a 
                          very hot weather girl.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys 
                          aren't going to be able to get married today.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I know.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. 
                          You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't 
                          you guys just do it on the street?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What? </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I 
                          mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This 
                          could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (Turning to Mike) What do you think? </p>
                        <p>Mike: I think I wanna get married to you today. </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you 
                          think we could do it?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!</p>
                        <p>[Scene: Outside. They are a bunch of people arranging 
                          chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.]<br>
                          Monica: (walking around with her headset still on) OK 
                          LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas 
                          lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs 
                          light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the 
                          ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) 
                          ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)</p>
                        <p>Mike's mom: Michael!</p>
                        <p>Mike: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses 
                          his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married 
                          in the street isn't something you approve of...</p>
                        <p>Mike's mom: No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. 
                          I could look at them forever. </p>
                        <p>Mike's dad: (leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill 
                          and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.</p>
                        <p>Mike: (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too 
                          small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have 
                          to walk him down the aisle.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: So technically, would this person be in the 
                          wedding?</p>
                        <p>Mike: I guess.</p>
                        <p>Chandler and Ross: I'll do it!</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared 
                          of dogs?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) 
                          I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE 
                          CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in 
                          the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not 
                          a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just 
                          called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.</p>
                        <p>Mike: Oh, no! </p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from 
                          your wedding.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Really?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister 
                          and start paying to ride the subway? Uhh-uh...</p>
                        <p>Ross: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... 
                          yeah we do.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have 
                          to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (quickly) I'll do it.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'll...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... 
                          (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) 
                          Ah ah...</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, 
                          come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, 
                          who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. 
                          He is clearly disgusted by it.)</p>
                        <p>(Cut to inside Central Perk where Rachel is helping 
                          Phoebe. Chandler and Monica enter.)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's 
                          giving you away.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)</p>
                        <p>Monica: So, you're ready to do this?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she 
                          gives her a kiss)</p>

                          Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what 
                          the hell. (the girls hug)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I love you guys.</p>
                        <p>Rachel and Monica: I love you.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All 
                          teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad 
                          boy on the road.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to 
                          wear that head set in bed tonight?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled 
                          for nudity at 2300 hours.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay Marjorie, hit it.</p>
                        <p>(A woman with a steel drum and a guy with a xylophone

                          and a groomsman walk down the isle. Next are Rachel 
                          and Ross, who carries Chappy in his arms.)</p>

                          there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've 
                          got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh,

                          happiness. So does Mike who watches her walk down the 
                          isle. When Phoebe and Chandler arrive, they kiss and

                          here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now 
                          spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short 
                          version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each 
                          other. And I know I speak for every one here... when 
                          I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?</p>
                        <p>(one of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey)</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal 
                          mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, 
                          and I always knew that something was missing. But now 
                          I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything 
                          I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts 
                          the ring on Mikes finger)</p>
                        <p>Mike: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're 
                          so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day 
                          with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky 
                          I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. 
                          (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... 
                          and you have nice eyes.</p>
                        <p>Mike: I love you too. </p>
                        <p>Ross: Uh Joey...</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be 
                          your husband?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I do.</p>
                        <p>(Joey has a "Yeah you do" smile on his face)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?</p>
                        <p>Mike: I do.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I now pronounce you... husband and wife.</p>
                        <p>(Phoebe and Mike kiss)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone 
                          get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.</p>
                        <p>(Mike takes off his coat to give to Phoebe and the 
                          steel band plays "The Wedding Song")</p>
                        <p>COMMERCIAL BREAK<br>
                          [Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler 
                          and Joey are walking up the stairs.]<br>
                          Chandler: That really was an incredible wedding.</p>
                        <p>Joey: It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. 
                          Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm 
                          about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that 
                          hot girl he was talking to.</p>
                        <p>(cut to the street in front of Central Perk where Ross 
                          is walking Chappy. He has a plastic bag in his hand.)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! 
                          I did not sign on for this.</p>
                        <p>THE END<br>
                        </p>
