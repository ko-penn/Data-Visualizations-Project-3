                        <p>Rachel: How was the honeymoon?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, 
                          moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh!</p>

                          whole time we were there!</p>

                        <p>Joey: I have an audition for this play and for some 
                          of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my 
                          résumé, I'm fluent in.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) 
                          By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (whispering) It was ok...</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce 
                          que tu penses alors?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh... you're so sexy!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be 
                          in this play.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.</p>

                          comes in about an hour.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if

                          but Monica slaps his hand)</p>

                        <p>Ross: What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and 
                          fat!</p>
                        <p>Ross: So, why is Erica coming to visit?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, because we want to get to know her better 
                          and she's never been to New York so she wants to see 
                          all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, 
                          Empire State Building...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, those places! There's always so many 
                          people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... 
                          you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do 
                          you do it?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! 
                          Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ross...</p>

                          wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there 
                          a sale at Barney's?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while 
                          I was at Barney’s. </p>

                        <p>Ross: Is-is he ok?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's 
                          still heavily sedated.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with 
                          you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) 
                          I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this 
                          on my own.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Still-still, let me come... for me.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly 
                          baked cookies.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, I really could.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes 
                          two cookies and she looks at him angrily)</p>

                          or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring 
                          at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward 
                          him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her 
                          more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when 
                          she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls 
                          down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't

                          we?</p>

                          and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel 
                          it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking 
                          advantage of you.</p>

                        <p>Ross: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think 
                          one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna 
                          go!</p>

                          boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute 
                          and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica

                        <p>Erica: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I

                          sorta overlapped. </p>
                        <p>Chandler: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go 
                          to college too? </p>
                        <p>Erica: No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from

                          a great guy. </p>

                          I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, 
                          it could be the football guy. </p>
                        <p>Chandler: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we 
                          not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out 
                          which one the father is. </p>
                        <p>Monica: How? </p>
                        <p>Chandler: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, 
                          right?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. </p>
                        <p>Chandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. 
                          He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo 
                          that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!</p>

                        <p>Joey: Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. 
                          Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.</p>
                        <p>Casting assistant: I'm sorry, what's going on?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Dude, come on! French it u-up!</p>
                        <p>Director: Joey, do you speak French?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!</p>
                        <p>Director: You know what. I think this audition is over. 
                          (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am 
                          Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard 
                          this man speaking the regional dialect of my French 
                          town of Estée Lauder.</p>
                        <p>Director: You really think this man is speaking French?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Sa-sa-saw!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. 
                          C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. 
                          (Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's 
                          my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)</p>
                        <p>(The director looks at Joey and he nods.)</p>
                        <p>&lt;"&gt;Phoebe: Alors, si vous pouviez jouer 
                          le jeu avec lui... (Translation: So, would you please 
                          just humor him?) </p>
                        <p>Director: (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was 
                          some really good French. But I think we're gonna go 
                          with someone else for the part.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ah. All right. But my French was good?</p>
                        <p>Director: It was great.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation: 
                          Thanks, goodbye.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.</p>
                        <p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting 
                          at the kitchen counter and Ross enters from Rachel and 
                          Emma's room.]<br>
                          Ross: Emma's down for the night.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, good.</p>
                        <p>Ross: So uh... I guess I wanna take off.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I 
                          again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming 
                          with me.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, no problem.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about 
                          what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... 
                          it's probably not a great idea to go down that road 
                          again.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Thank you. I'm glad you agree.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, 
                          it was pretty good.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah... Yeah, that's true.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great 
                          time...?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, ye-ah!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: You know it was you're uhm... birthday...</p>
                        <p>Ross: ...Valentine's day...</p>
                        <p>Both: (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hmmm-mmmm.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (after a pause) Not even one more time?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Not even once.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No matter how much we want it.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Even if we want it really bad.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: That's what we decided.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Uhm, right!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: ...It's kinda hard though!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: You know, when two people have a connection, 
                          you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.</p>
                        <p>Ross: ...I hate waste.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: ...Ross?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yes?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Just so you know... With us... it's never off 
                          the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves 
                          the apartment)</p>

                          are "updating" Joey's resumé.]<br>
                          Phoebe: Okay, can you really tapdance?</p>
                        <p>Joey: No.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: It's off the resumé. (she strikes it 
                          through with a pencil)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Archery?</p>
                        <p>Joey: No.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Horseback riding?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Would fall off a lot.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?</p>
                        <p>Joey: That I can do.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 
                          10 seconds?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Al, right, watch me! (he takes a full container 
                          of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ready... GO!</p>
                        <p>(Joey takes the plastic container to his mouth and 
                          starts to drink. Most of the milk gushes from the bottle 
                          down his chin and over his clothes to the floor. He 
                          keeps "drinking" and all of a sudden he lifts 
                          it up and half the bottle of milk pours out in an instant. 
                          He then continues to drink the rest. He then puts the 
                          empty container down on the counter.)</p>
