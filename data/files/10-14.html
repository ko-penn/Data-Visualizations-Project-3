                        <p>Mike: (raising his glass) Thank you guys for having 
                          us over.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married 
                          couples more often.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes 
                          about swinging and scare them away.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like 
                          you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)</p>
                        <p>Ross: (entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner 
                          here.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they 
                          all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess 
                          what happened at work today...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: A dinosaur died a million years ago?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try 
                          sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and 
                          I hear it's looking really good.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Wow!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in 
                          academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (while entering) Hi you guys.</p>
                        <p>All: Hey.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate) </p>
                        <p>Monica: No one wanted seconds, right?</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, no. I-I'm good.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe 
                          it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow 
                          with Gucci. Gucci wants me.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'm up for tenure.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Congratulations!</p>

                        <p>Rachel: Ooh! (they hug)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly 
                          at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.</p>
                        <p>Monica: I don't know who I'm happiest for...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking 
                          at Joey)</p>

                        <p>Monica: No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats 
                          Chandler on his leg)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Where did you go to do it?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: YOU NEVER DID IT!</p>
                        <p>Monica: I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official 
                          Bing.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who 
                          am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing 
                          die with me.</p>
                        <p>Mike: (walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here 
                          you go.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your 
                          name?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. 
                          You've got to live with it. </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Mrs Hannigan?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? 
                          Ooh, I like it.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (enters) Hey guys.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've 
                          got to check out at the new house. You want to come 
                          with us?</p>
                        <p>Joey: No, thank you.</p>
                        <p>Monica: All right. I know you're not happy about us 
                          moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the 
                          house.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close 
                          it is to the city.</p>
                        <p>Joey: But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? 
                          I couldn't even find it on the map.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to 
                          us.</p>
                        <p>Joey: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be 
                          supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Damn it.</p>
                        <p>Monica: See you guys later.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Okay!</p>
                        <p>Monica: (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad 
                          you're coming.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Good for you. That was really mature.</p>
                        <p>Joey: What? No, the only reason I'm going to their 
                          stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's 
                          wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them 
                          stay here.</p>
                        <p>Mike: You're a strange kind of grown-up.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Joey, you can't make someone do something they 
                          don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've 
                          been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... 
                          he's just... </p>
                        <p>Mike: Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that 
                          right now?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler 
                          really love this house. You are not gonna talk them 
                          into staying here.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, 
                          you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". 
                          What is it?</p>
                        <p>(Phoebe whispers something in Joey's ear, but after 
                          hearing it he jumps up, shocked)</p>
                        <p>Joey: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he 
                          leaves)</p>

                          with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. 
                          It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.</p>
                        <p>Maitre d': Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show 
                          you to his table.</p>

                          Sitting there is mr Zellner, her boss from her current 
                          job at Ralph Lauren.) </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat 
                          us somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>Maitre d': I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing 
                          for another job.</p>
                        <p>Maitre d': I know. With Gukki </p>

                        <p>Mr Zellner: Rachel?</p>

                        <p>Mr Zellner: (confused) That's great!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single 
                          mom, career... You gotta get out there.</p>
                        <p>Mr Zellner: Well, you got uhm... good energy.</p>

                          (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs) </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't 
                          call my online dating profile a resumé.</p>
                        <p>Mr Campbell: Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about 
                          the work resumé.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened 
                          to just singing for no reason? Huh?</p>
                        <p>Mr Campbell: Maybe people... found it weird.... So, 
                          why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: What? I-I don't.</p>

                          depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she

                        <p>Clerk: How can I help you? </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I need to change my name, please. See, I need

                          it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's 
                          name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan

                          I was having my interview and he heard everything. So 
                          later he calls me to his office and he tells me that 
                          he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team 
                          player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." 
                          and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved 
                          that that in fact... was true. </p>

                        <p>Ross: But also knowing it means a lot.</p>
                        <p>Monica: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.</p>
                        <p>Ross: ...that center around work.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: To Ross!</p>

                          the taste of it)</p>
                        <p>Ross: You know what the best part about this is? I 
                          can never be fired.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh God!</p>
                        <p>Ross: No seriously. I have job security for life. You 
                          know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) 
                          Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. 
                          And I didn't get the other job.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Rach, I'm so sorry.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Great. I feel like an idiot.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, it's okay, you didn't know.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have 
                          been nice.</p>

                        <p>Chandler: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow 
                          means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank 
                          you.</p>
                        <p>Realtor: Take as long as you want. Just let me know 
                          when you're through. (she leaves the room) </p>
                        <p>Monica: Ah, so glad you decided to come.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy 
                          for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: What?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.</p>
                        <p>Monica: No it's not. We had an inspection and they 
                          didn't find anything.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy 
                          throat for no reason.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of 
                          the window like a dog the whole ride here.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's 
                          pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in 
                          a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs 
                          out and hits him) </p>

                          I just saw a bat in the corner!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: When your head was hanging out the window, 
                          it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?</p>
                        <p>Joey: (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) 
                          Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than 
                          this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard 
                          time with this, but we really, we love it here. </p>
                        <p>Joey: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then 
                          you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get 
                          used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back 
                          to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... </p>

                          about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box 
                          and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the 
                          chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly 
                          in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of 
                          the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)</p>

                        <p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's new house. Sitting near 
                          the window, they look at the neighborhood.]</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big 
                          front yards, the actual picket fences.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Man, those two dogs are going at it!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (entering) Hey!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Hey, where have you been?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But 
                          you know what? This house... is great.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Really? What changed your mind?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made 
                          me feel a lot better about the whole thing.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, 
                          but she died like 30 years ago.</p>
                        <p>(Joey's eyes double in size)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (frightened) What?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Ha! I'm just messing with you.</p>
                        <p>Joey: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little 
                          girl ghosts!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, 
                          do you wanna go see your room?</p>
                        <p>Joey: What? I get my own room?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You don't think we'd buy a house and not 
                          have a Joey room do you?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have 
                          an aquarium? And a sex swing?</p>
                        <p>Chandler and Monica: No!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage 
                          client.</p>
                        <p>Mike: Oh! Why don't you introduce me?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.</p>
                        <p>Rita: Oh! (they shake hands)</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: (without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) 
                          Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.</p>
                        <p>Rita: Crap Bag?</p>
                        <p>Mike: If you need an easy way to remember it, just 
                          think of a bag of crap.</p>
                        <p>Rita: Okay. Excuse me...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. 
                          Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Really?</p>

                        <p>Monica: No.</p>
                        <p>Ross: She's still at dinner?</p>
                        <p>Monica: I guess. Why? Who's she with?</p>
                        <p>Ross: That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks 
                          he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants 
                          to sleep with her.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) 
                          My time machine works!</p>
                        <p>Ross: We ran into him on the street today and he said 
                          he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants 
                          to get into her pants.</p>
                        <p>Monica: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, 
                          she's single and he's cute.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Excuse me?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't 
                          stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the 
                          whole time.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: For your information, I was staring at her 
                          baby. We're about to be parents.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, sorry!</p>
                        <p>(She looks at Ross, a bit ashamed. Chandler mimes "big 
                          breasts" to Ross and lip syncs "Wow". 
                          Ross looks at him, astonished and then Monica looks 
                          at Chandler again. A little too late he changes the 
                          "big breasts" mime into "rocking a baby". 
                          When he realizes Monica might have seen it he also strokes 
                          his imaginary baby's head.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (entering) Hi you guys!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (speaking without pause, agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? 
                          I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly 
                          want?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His 
                          wife just had twins.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Should we send something?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: How did the job stuff go?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: He offered me one.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That's great!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Congratulations!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so 
                          much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money 
                          is great...</p>
                        <p>Ross: Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said 
                          something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe 
                          me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) 
                          You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each 
                          other)</p>

                        <p>Joey: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... 
                          am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought 
                          of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying 
                          to do more independent movies?</p>
                        <p>Mackenzie: (at the other end of the line) I don't know... 
                          You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold 
                          on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey bear, I need some career advice.</p>
