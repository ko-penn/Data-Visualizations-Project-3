                          are talking]</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: All right, all right, all right, 
                          let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win 
                          <em>you do not move to Paris.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Ok! Can't believe I'm risking 
                          this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember 
                          the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Just flip!</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong> (she flips the coin): Ha, tails!</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Damnit!</p>
                        <p>(Chandler and Monica enter the room)</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Hey!</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Hey!</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: So we thought we'd throw 
                          you little going away party around seven.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh, that sounds good!</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Hey, Rach, you're leaving 
                          tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: It's all done!</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh, yeah, right! And after 
                          I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on 
                          the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: I know... Honey, seriously, 
                          I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the 
                          bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes 
                          that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that 
                          I made for the plane...</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Ok, so you've done some good 
                          work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Oh, well. Everything that 
                          I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel 
                          documents are on the counter organized in the order 
                          that I will be needing them.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh my God! I have nothing 
                          left to teach you! (they hug)</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Where's your passport?</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: It should be right next to 
                          my plane ticket.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Well, it's not.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: What? Maybe I put it in here 
                          (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, 
                          no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Here, let me help you. (they 
                          both start opening boxes)</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Shoot. Oh, I can't believe 
                          I did this!</p>

                          did it stop being funny that I took her passport?</p>

                          like three weeks away?</p>

                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: No, I don't mind you touching

                          the part where the baby is gonna come out.</p>

                          (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: That's because I'm pregnant!</p>

                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid 
                          that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. </p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: No, no, I knew (he stares at 
                          her breasts).</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong> (to Ross): Okay, well, stop

                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks 
                          I won't be able to travel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Yeah, and I wanted her to 
                          get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Hotel? Why isn't she staying 
                          with you guys?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Because we're moving in a 
                          couple of days and it just didn't make sense.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: Plus hotels are fun! My room 
                          has this little fridge full of free snacks!</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Erica, those things aren't free. 
                          In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any 
                          consumer product...</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Ross! She's giving us her 
                          baby. She can eat <em>you</em> if she wants.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong> (standing up): I'll be right 
                          back.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Oh man, I can't believe you 
                          guys are leaving this place.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you 
                          know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still 
                          in Nana's name.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: No, no. This will always be 
                          <em>your</em> place. It would be too sad. Plus, how 
                          much a month does it cost to feed Joey?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Yeah, it takes two incomes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked 
                          about catching a movie.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh, no. He doesn't have time 
                          for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey 
                          pack up the guest room.</p>

                          right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of 
                          the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever

                          don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy:

                          a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose 
                          Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I 
                          mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!</p>

                          the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel 
                          internationally again!</p>

                          and I was gonna save it until the end of the night,

                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: What are you talking about? 
                          These aren't mine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh yeah, right! Good luck 
                          getting another scarf dance from me!</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: That would be a <em>terrible</em> 
                          punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these 
                          before.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Really? Then what are they 
                          doing in our guestroom?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Rachel used to live in that 
                          room.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Rachel... with handcuffs! 
                          Interesting! (he looks excited)</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Joey's bare ass!</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: (he doesn't look excited 
                          anymore). Well played.</p>

                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: I love you too. (they hug) 
                          Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French 
                          bitch! (they hug again)</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: All right. Well, if I gonna 
                          do this, I'd better keep going.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Ok.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Ok. Monica?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Yeah?</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Can you come here with me 
                          for a minute?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Sure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: (to Monica) Are you wearing 
                          waterproof mascara?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: No.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica 
                          goes into the guest room)</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: (to Phoebe) Hey. What was that 
                          all about?</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: She's gonna say goodbye to 
                          each of us individually.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Are you kidding? Oh my God...</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be 
                          even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some 
                          serious crying.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ross</strong>: Oh, man, I'm not going to be 
                          able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students 
                          feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by 
                          giving me such bad evaluations.</p>

                          just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing 
                          things that have happened to me in the last ten years, 
                          would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has 
                          been more like a sister to me...</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: I know what you mean. You're 
                          like a sister to me too. </p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (starts crying and speaking 
                          at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand 
                          what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do 
                          without you... </p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: (having the same problem) 
                          You're the best friend I ever had.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: (says something that cannot

                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: I... I... I... (again saying

                          Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I 
                          could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks 
                          like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing 
                          you said about the thing. It really made me think about 
                          that other thing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Uh, Rach?</p>

                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: I really made you think about

                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: (to Rachel) Uh, Rach... 
                          I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows

                          don't get.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: No, no, no... They're really 
                          yours. We... found them in your old room.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe 
                          Monica used to use them with...</p>

                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: I think these are yours.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: These are not mine... Look 
                          how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang 
                          a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like 
                          a piece of licorice.</p>

                          I mean it <em>is</em> difficult to say goodbye to <em>five</em> 
                          people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... 
                          (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You 
                          know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe 
                          <em>this</em> is how you want to leave things between 
                          us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the 
                          apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)</p>

                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: I'm sure he's not more bummed

                          know how to throw a party.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: All right, I think I'm gonna

                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Uh, where do you think you're 
                          going?</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: I thought I was going home 
                          to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less 
                          fun for me to do here.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: We're moving in a couple of 
                          days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would 
                          be great if you guys could pitch in.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Joey and I can finish up 
                          in the guest room.</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he

                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Okay, we're gonna start in 
                          the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and 
                          stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in 
                          rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe and Joey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Good! Now I need you to be 
                          careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with 
                          you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Hey Mon, I think I figured 
                          out whose handcuffs they are.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: You did? How?</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Well, I was cleaning out 
                          the closet and I found some pictures of them... being 
                          used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh my God! Let me see. (they 
                          all look at the pictures)</p>
                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Who's that dirty old lady?</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Monica's grandmother.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Nana liked it <em>rough!</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: Come on here, have a seat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Phoebe</strong>: How was your night?</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: Oh, it was okay. I went to 
                          a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went 
                          to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she 
                          is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, 
                          they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Erica, are you okay?</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate 
                          too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come 
                          and go like every few minutes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Relax! We just get her some 
                          antacids.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: She doesn't have a stomach 
                          ache, she's in labor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Oh my God!</p>

                          hospital.</p>

                          coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! 
                          Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're 
                          gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! 
                          Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. 
                          Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)</p>
                        <p><strong>Chandler</strong>: Honey, it's gonna be okay.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: You can do this. Just breathe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel 
                          a little better.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erica</strong>: (in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?</p>
                        <p><strong>Monica</strong>: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, 
                          let's go. Okay bye everyone.</p>
                        <p>(there's a lot of supportive cheers from all. Erica, 
                          Monica and Chandler leave.)</p>

                        <p><strong>Joey</strong>: If you get a second, find out 
                          where she got that cheeseburger.</p>

                          because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, 
                          you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there,
