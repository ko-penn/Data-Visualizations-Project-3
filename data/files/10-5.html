                            and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)</p>

                            cake, isn't it?</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Mike:</strong> (puts on a fake 
                            smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? 
                            (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with 
                            a napkin)</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> What's the 
                            matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, 
                            I'm sorry!</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Mike:</strong> No! It's my fault. 
                            I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and 
                            all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want 
                            to spend the rest of my life with you.</p>

                          <p align="left"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Oh my God!</p>
                          <p align="left">(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Mike:</strong> Phoebe, I...</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Wait! Oh wait! 
                            (she takes off a ring that was already on her left 
                            ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, 
                            but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all 
                            her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these 
                            off.)</p>

                          <p align="left"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Uh-huh! (and 
                            now Mike kneels properly)</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Mike:</strong> Phoebe, I love 
                            you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask 
                            to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care 
                            of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... 
                            Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Phoebe:</strong> Yes!</p>
                          <p align="left">(Mike puts the ring on her finger)</p>
                          <p align="left"><strong>Mike:</strong> I love you!</p>

                            (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna 
                            be Mrs. No Balls.</p>
