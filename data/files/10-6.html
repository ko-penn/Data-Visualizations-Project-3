                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around 
                          this... (she shows her ring)HUGE engagement ring!</p>
                        <p>All: OH!</p>

                        <p>Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech 
                          prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys 
                          look at him) Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most 
                          romantic thing ever.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast 
                          Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy 
                          in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna 
                          say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!</p>
                        <p>All: Whoo!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something 
                          for you!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Mmh-mmh!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the 
                          numbers of all the guys I've dated.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know 
                          what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of 
                          your other single girlfriends? </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and 
                          start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, my first love! </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh!</p>
                        <p>Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's 
                          name mean?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, 
                          no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was 
                          in the first wave at Omaha Beach.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys 
                          my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't 
                          so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number 
                          on it.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.</p>

                          Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]<br>
                          Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his 
                          back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) 
                          Hi sweetie!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Is Monica not here?</p>
                        <p>Joey: No.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding 
                          for a big account and they got it! It's my first national 
                          commercial!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Cool!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of 
                          the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? 
                          All the ideas were mine!!!</p>
                        <p>Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think 
                          you're right for the part.</p>
                        <p>Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! 
                          Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then 
                          he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) 
                          Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! 
                          What can't I do?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't 
                          think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy 
                          college professor.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, 
                          I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important 
                          things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, 
                          what's the product?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business 
                          networking e-solutions?</p>
                        <p>Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm 
                          cold!</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch 
                          and Ross enters.]<br>
                          Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! 
                          I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. </p>
                        <p>Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with 
                          his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations! 
                        </p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat 
                          out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys 
                          I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping 
                          score or anything... five!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if 
                          I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field 
                          research! And there will be an article about me in the 
                          "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the 
                          first time my name is in there, without people raising 
                          serious questions about my work!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah. Why?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your 
                          new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend 
                          is screwed!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, 
                          if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? 
                          Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can 
                          introduce you.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Well, if you think it would help.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you 
                          know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex 
                          fetish.</p>
                        <p>Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.</p>
                        <p>Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings 
                          into boxes.]<br>
                          Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey! </p>
                        <p>Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day 
                          clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, right.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah. </p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well 
                          help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen 
                          to have my label maker!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you 
                          and Chandler have to make compromises when you first 
                          moved in together?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to 
                          give up?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants 
                          me to get rid of Gladys.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific 
                          painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of 
                          the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What 
                          a tragic loss!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! 
                          Oh, you should take her!</p>
                        <p>Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't 
                          know...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll 
                          take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're 
                          giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to 
                          fight for her!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Really? You think?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry 
                          Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to 
                          me!"</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I 
                          just realized... if I do that, that means you don't 
                          get her.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey you guys. </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Hi!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for 
                          the part.</p>
                        <p>Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor 
                          you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never 
                          gonna be interested in.</p>
                        <p>Joey(to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's not like 
                          I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do 
                          for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances 
                          at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours 
                          late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's 
                          a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that 
                          I've been in.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Joe...</p>
                        <p>Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you 
                          don't pass it on to your bosses!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Fine!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Work, Joe!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)</p>
                        <p>Chandler(to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Just pass it to your boss!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest 
                          him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's 
                          something they should learn on their own!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and 
                          you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, 
                          you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he 
                          sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, 
                          for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).</p>

                          Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for 
                          her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin Hobart]</p>
                        <p>Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. 
                          I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd 
                          invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's 
                          any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks 
                          like it's just him.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: So good to see you.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for 
                          very long and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, 
                          until they stop)</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'm ok.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) 
                          Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.</p>
                        <p>Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how 
                          long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that 
                          Nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to 
                          tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into 
                          the field.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. 
                          I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's 
                          nice to be nice! </p>
                        <p>Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes 
                          Ross' chair).</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't 
                          believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember 
                          the night?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) 
                          Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this 
                          place! (they laugh more, and Ross start laughing too).</p>
                        <p>Benjamin(to Ross): You weren't there!</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, 
                          you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... 
                          (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your 
                          proposal, while I go to the ladies room?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: So, tell me about it.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted 
                          desert.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: M-m.</p>
                        <p>Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't 
                          been fully excavated.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Break up with Charlie!</p>
                        <p>Ross: What?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: What?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and 
                          no, I didn't not say it.</p>

                        <p>Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so 
                          long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting 
                          to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need 
                          you to break up with her.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Are you serious?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say 
                          no then I'm joking!</p>
                        <p>Ross: No!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let 
                          me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your 
                          battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, 
                          with the woman coming out of the frame.</p>

                        <p>Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already 
                          gave that to Monica, so...</p>
                        <p>Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.</p>
                        <p>Monica: But I want to.</p>

                        <p>Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair

                          Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three 
                          of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision 
                          will be based upon the answers you give to the questions 
                          I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you 
                          claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic 
                          system. How do you propose to correct this problem?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the 
                          osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: (nods) Interesting.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field 
                          work. Where might that take place?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of 
                          South Dakota.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when 
                          is my birthday?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? 
                          I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's 
                          wrong? Answer the question")</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Care to venture a guess?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's 
                          not even kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. 
                          Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Li: Half a dozen.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles 
                          hit was later covered by a popular British invasion 
                          band?</p>
                        <p>Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate 
                          students. </p>
                        <p>Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby 
                          It's You". Baby It's You.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None 
                          of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last 
                          question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".</p>
                        <p>Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell 
                          it correctly) B - O - S ...</p>

                          ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before

                          paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.

                        <p>(Ross shakes his head)</p>
                        <p>Ross: You're crazy.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Crazy!</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Ooor...</p>
                        <p>Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)</p>

                          Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]<br>
                          (Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and 
                          sees Gladys placed on the barcalounger.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: O-oh my God!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?</p>
                        <p>Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a 
                          very reasonable price.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!</p>
                        <p>Joey: But it's an original Buffay...</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as 
                          you don't mind that she's haunted. </p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes 
                          alive when you're asleep.</p>
                        <p>(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously 
                          from Rachel to Gladys and back.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags 
                          her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs 
                          to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her 
                          one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns 
                          your doorknob.</p>
                        <p>Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!</p>
                        <p>(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She 
                          then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can 
                          play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)</p>
                        <p>Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she 
                          pushes the painting back to Rachel)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)</p>
                        <p>Monica: No you can't. She's yours!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's yours!</p>
                        <p>Monica: SHE'S YOURS!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's yours!</p>
                        <p>(While they are both pushing the painting towards each 
                          other, Phoebe enters)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Monica: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight 
                          over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and 
                          enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One 
                          of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish 
                          dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. 
                          Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever 
                          doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica 
                          are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece 
                          of art.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I want Gladys!</p>
                        <p>Monica: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Monica: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: She's mine!</p>
                        <p>Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading 
                          a Sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]<br>
                          Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. 
                          And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think 
                          you are right for the part or not.</p>
                        <p>Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that 
                          you lied.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take 
                          for you to forgive me?</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on 
                          the couch.]<br>
                          Monica: Oh my God!</p>
                        <p>(we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler 
                          is wearing the blue Ichiban lipstick!)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Excellent!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Now, what do you say?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Lying is wrong!</p>
                        <p>Joey: And?... AND?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I knew it!</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group 
                          has left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]<br>
                          Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Did you get the grant?</p>
                        <p>Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because 
                          your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: What?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because 
                          I wouldn't give you up.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke 
                          up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant 
                          review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.</p>
                        <p>Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, 
                          okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological 
                          question.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Seriously?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... 
                          How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, 
                          then M-B-O... </p>
                        <p>Ross: Damnit!</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]<br>
                          Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... 
                          what are you doing here?</p>
                        <p>Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the 
                          deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions 
                          you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview 
                          Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty 
                          useless trivia.</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look 
                          her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Benji?</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But 
                          it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything 
                          to have you back in my life.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: I can't believe this.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I 
                          think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still 
                          think about me? </p>
                        <p>Ross: (indignant) No!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Yes!</p>
                        <p>Ross: What?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all 
                          so.... romantic.</p>
                        <p>Ross: or...</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds 
                          here, but is there any chance you will take me back?</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Maybe...</p>
                        <p>Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make 
                          me a little uncomfortable.</p>
                        <p>Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her 
                          hand on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much 
                          history between us, you know...</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm 
                          sorry too...</p>
                        <p>(Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down 
                          Ross's face, until their hands meet, and they hold hands.)</p>
                        <p>Benjamin: I love you!</p>
                        <p>Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!</p>
                        <p><br>
                          COMMERCIAL BREAK</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the 
                          penguin right next to him.]<br>
                          (There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from 
                          the living room, and Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls 
                          his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Gladys?</p>
                        <p>(The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her 
                          frame though. Joey panics and moves frantically, screaming. 
                          Then there is laughing, and the painting is lowered. 
                          It was Rachel holding Gladys.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does 
                          not get old.</p>
                        <p>Joey: You're mean!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!</p>
                        <p>(She closes his door again, and turns around. Then 
                          she starts screaming, terrified. There is Glynnis... 
                          And Monica holding her up, laughing.)</p>
