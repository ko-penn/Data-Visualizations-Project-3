                          [Scene: Central Perk]</p>
                        <p>(Joey and Ross enter. Phoebe and Mike are sitting on 
                          the couch, reading a magazine.)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hey you guys!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the 
                          food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked 
                          when I first heard the numbers.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So what did you two do about it?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up 
                          with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a 
                          list and Monica told me to go to hell.</p>
                        <p>Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna 
                          have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you 
                          a lot of money.</p>
                        <p>Mike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar 
                          a year industry.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half 
                          of that.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could 
                          be put to better use?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Are you serious?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all 
                          the wedding money to charity and we just got married 
                          at City Hall?</p>
                        <p>Mike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even 
                          more. (he kisses her)</p>
                        <p>Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible 
                          gesture!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you 
                          get married!</p>
                        <p>Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii 
                          at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!</p>

                          have it both ways!</p>

                          you... get a baby?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us 
                          and see where we live.</p>
                        <p>Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she 
                          doesn't like something about us she can keep us off 
                          every adoption list in the state.</p>

                          opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people 
                          know a celebrity.</p>

                        <p>Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless 
                          you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn 
                          or cigarettes?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: What...? NO!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Chandler?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended) 
                          I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, 
                          or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet 
                          tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, 
                          but that tape is not mine.</p>
                        <p>Monica: It isn't mine!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I

                          and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the 
                          chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a 
                          big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for 
                          weeks!</p>
                        <p>Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder

                          that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out 
                          we do.</p>
                        <p>Charity guy: So you’re asking us to refund your 
                          donation to the children?</p>
                        <p>Mike: Yeah! This feels really good.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just 
                          really important to me.</p>
                        <p>Charity guy: Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes 
                          their check from a drawer) besides it’s probably 
                          a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the 
                          children, all those food, and warm clothing…</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s 
                          wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t 
                          have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. 
                          And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire 
                          yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words 
                          wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve 
                          a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty 
                          little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms 
                          out)</p>
                        <p>Mike: She could have been talking about either one 
                          of us.</p>

                        <p>Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy

                          didn't end very well.</p>

                        <p>Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to 
                          get out of here. You slept with <br>
                          our social worker and you never called her back and 
                          she is still pissed, so she can't <br>
                          see you.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Ok!</p>
                        <p>(Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler 
                          walks towards the living room, but then Joey enters 
                          again.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: What?</p>
                        <p>Joey: I forgot my bat.</p>
                        <p>(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica 
                          and Laura enter the living room again. When Laura sees 
                          Joey, she freezes...)</p>
                        <p>Laura: Oh my God!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to 
                          be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! 
                          (Joey lowers his bat)</p>
                        <p>Laura: What are you doing here?</p>
                        <p>Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!</p>
                        <p>Laura: Are you friends with him?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I can explain... Joey...</p>
                        <p>Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got 
                          some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never 
                          called me.</p>
                        <p>Laura: Excuse me?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember 
                          my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling 
                          me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! 
                          I waited weeks for you to call me.</p>
                        <p>Laura: I gave you my number, you never called me.</p>
                        <p>Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, 
                          ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you 
                          can just... do.</p>
                        <p>Laura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, 
                          I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful 
                          woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? 
                          If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?</p>
                        <p>Laura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm 
                          sorry...</p>
                        <p>Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? 
                          You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to 
                          sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, 
                          leaving her shocked)</p>
                        <p>Laura: Joey, wait!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't 
                          wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)</p>
                        <p>Laura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had 
                          to see that. I'm so embarrassed...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, that's really ok.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is 
                          hard.</p>
                        <p>Laura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to 
                          say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.</p>
                        <p>(Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey 
                          enters the apartment again.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)</p>

                          about the children. </p>

                          Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls 
                          it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!</p>
                        <p>Charity guy: If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically 
                          pointing to Phoebe) congratulations!</p>
                        <p>Mike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! 
                          Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! 
                          As your future husband I'm going to make this decision 
                          for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should 
                          do?</p>
                        <p>Charity guy: You know what? It's not your decision

                          Come on! Consider it a contribution. (gives the check 
                          to Phoebe)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) 
                          Well, this is very generous!</p>
                        <p>Charity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great 
                          wedding and a wonderful life together.</p>
                        <p>Mike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that 
                          way we can save up, come back in a few years and make 
                          an even bigger donation.</p>
