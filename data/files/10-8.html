                          others are sitting on the couch.]</p>

                        <p>Monica: We need to talk to you about something.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving 
                          this year.</p>
                        <p>All: What?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Are you kidding?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress 
                          of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. 
                          Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden 
                          falls on us. </p>
                        <p>Ross: (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's 
                          Monica talking!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: No, no! We made this decision together. </p>
                        <p>Ross: She's putting words in your mouth!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put 
                          turkey in people's mouths!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first 
                          Thanksgiving!</p>
                        <p>Monica: No, it's not!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she 
                          born?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, personally I think it's great you're 
                          giving yourself a break.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Thank you, Pheebs!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year 
                          wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.</p>
                        <p>Monica: What? You are way off, lady!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook 
                          Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think 
                          about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than 
                          you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.</p>
                        <p>Monica: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing 
                          this!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between 
                          me... and ME!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We are supposed to make these decisions together! 
                          Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?</p>

                        <p>Monica: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from 
                          that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for 
                          me?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You're not making the pies yourself?</p>
                        <p>Monica: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When 
                          I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. 
                          I ate so many that just the thought of them made me 
                          sick.</p>

                        <p>Monica: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, 
                          I see you guys at 4.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Can't wait!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: What's Emma doing today?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has 
                          a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a 
                          very big poop. Why?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.</p>

                          ever heard!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend 
                          Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's 
                          a real dog!</p>

                        <p>Rachel: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against 
                          another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just 
                          for a trophy... </p>
                        <p>Rachel: And a thousand dollars.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh 
                          please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in 
                          a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is 
                          important...</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for 
                          the competition.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I was thinking...</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch

                          and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.</p>

                        <p>Joey: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put 
                          it on your hand!</p>
                        <p>(Rachel, Phoebe and Emma arrive)</p>
                        <p>Ross: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh!</p>
                        <p>Joey: You are not at Thanksgiving?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: No... </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: No, we're late!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: What are you doing here!</p>
                        <p>Ross: We're late too! (Rachel screams)</p>
                        <p>Joey: We figured we could be late because you guys 
                          were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at 
                          the girls)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!</p>
                        <p>Ross: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah, where were you!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: And I won!</p>
                        <p>Ross: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from 
                          Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York 
                          Division.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah. That's me!</p>
                        <p>Ross: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: And it looks like she put makeup on her!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen 
                          that cowgirl outfit before...</p>
                        <p>Ross: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That 
                          you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable! 
                        </p>
                        <p>Rachel: She won a thousand dollars!</p>
                        <p>Ross: So this is an annual thing?</p>
                        <p>Joey: (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: You guys, there are people in there who are 
                          not getting any happier!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah. What are we gonna do?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, 
                          I got to put Emma down for a nap.</p>
                        <p>Joey: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw 
                          something on Alicia Mae. </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Alright, what are we gonna say?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't 
                          get mad at someone who's been mugged!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like 
                          you were mugged!</p>
                        <p>Joey: No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' 
                          shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)</p>
                        <p>Ross: (to Joey) HEY!</p>
                        <p> </p>
                        <p>[Scene: Monica's apartment.]</p>
                        <p>Monica: Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up 
                          and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (peeping) They're out there!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! 
                          They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, 
                          talking!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks 
                          like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" 
                          on it. They went to the game!</p>
                        <p>Monica: (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (looking through the peephole again) Ross' 
                          shirt is torn.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!</p>
                        <p>[Cut to the hall]</p>
                        <p>(Rachel comes out of her apartment}</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) 
                          what happened to your shirt?</p>
                        <p>Ross: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: We're just... we're trying to figure out an 
                          excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica 
                          told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right 
                          on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... 
                          or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops 
                          on her.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid 
                          of all the PCP we have lying around.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: You know what, we just say that she said it 
                          was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, 
                          we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note 
                          is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into 
                          the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)</p>
                        <p>Ross: (Reading the note) We know you're out there. 
                          (Rachel gasps)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (whispering) Who do you think its from?</p>
                        <p>[time lapse – they are still in the hall]</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Well, let's just go in there and face them.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein 
                          on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. </p>
                        <p>Joey: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play 
                          rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. 
                          (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor 
                          thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and 
                          Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward 
                          wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).</p>
                        <p>Joey: (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!</p>
                        <p>Ross: What is that? </p>
                        <p>Joey: That's fire. Beats everything.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She 
                          places her hand over his "fire" and mimics 
                          a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Joey: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just 
                          all go in at the same time.</p>
                        <p>All: Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and 
                          tries to open it but it's locked)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: It's locked.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're 
                          having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, 
                          my butt is surprisingly hairy". </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the 
                          door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. 
                          Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.</p>
                        <p>[cut to Monica and Chandler]</p>
                        <p>Monica: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out 
                          and the... the stuffing is all soggy.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce 
                          that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry 
                          sauce?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (relieved) Oh thank God!</p>
                        <p>[cut to the hall]</p>
                        <p>Ross: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway 
                          broke down.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, 
                          you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.</p>
                        <p>Ross: (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) 
                          FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his 
                          hand and throws it on the floor)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're 
                          late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can 
                          have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey 
                          on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)</p>
                        <p>Joey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did 
                          that. (Ross picks it up)</p>

                        <p>Joey: (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs 
                          the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something 
                          to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.</p>

                          just unlock the door.</p>

                          either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want 
                          to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)</p>

                        <p>Chandler: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. 
                          Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look 
                          away)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His 
                          eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler 
                          are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then 
                          to the others in the hall) Right guys?</p>
                        <p>(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's 
                          and Phoebe's at the bottom)</p>
                        <p>Ross: I feel terrible.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked 
                          so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice 
                          meal all together, huh?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: The floating heads do make a good point.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: So bad.</p>
                        <p>Ross : So bad.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: So bad.</p>
                        <p>Monica: (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and 
                          Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in. </p>
                        <p>Rachel: Dessert?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the 
                          pies. You did remember, right?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes 
                          to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her 
                          hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).</p>
                        <p>(Monica takes it and reads the label)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Grand Supreme Little Darling?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Congratulatioooons!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot 
                          believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're 
                          an hour late and you forget the one little thing that 
                          I asked you to do.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Really girls, not cool.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You 
                          lied about going to the game. You knew it would make 
                          you late, and you still went anyway.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? 
                          We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! 
                          A day of forgiveness!</p>
                        <p>Ross: It's a day to be thankful.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!</p>
                        <p>Monica: It's too late for apologies.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid 
                          dinner.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you 
                          weren't drooling.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ewww, is that what that is?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Sorry!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Yeah! I'll cook!</p>
                        <p>Ross: Yeah! Let's go out.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.</p>
                        <p>Monica: The three of us?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!</p>
                        <p>(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel 
                          and Ross pull back their heads)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ha!</p>
                        <p>(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices 
                          he is stuck)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Joey, that is not gonna work.</p>
                        <p>Joey: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I'll pull you through.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Okay.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried 
                          about damaging my head.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: A little late for that.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Alright, well, this does not change anything. 
                          (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease 
                          the sides of his face.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Bring it.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to 
                          the vein as a seperate person...</p>
                        <p>(Chandler gives Monica a footlong "eye dropper" 
                          with the turkey grease in it)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Here you go!</p>
                        <p>(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, that smells good!</p>
                        <p>(And he starts licking the grease which trickles down 
                          his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side 
                          of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Okay.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay, try it.</p>
                        <p>(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: It isn't working.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Can you ever feel your ears?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Interesting...</p>
                        <p>Monica: Chandler, where are your tools?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... 
                          I don't have tools!</p>
                        <p>Monica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I lent them to Ross.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I gave them to Joey.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I left them at the park.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh!</p>
                        <p>Ross: (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really 
                          hard not to mess with him.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts 
                          down his pants.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Nice!</p>
                        <p>(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, 
                          I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving 
                          is over. The Vein has spoken.</p>
                        <p>Joey: It's really starting to hurt.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and 
                          you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough 
                          room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something 
                          here.</p>
                        <p>(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and 
                          are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Come on guys, PUSH!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah! Come on!</p>
                        <p>Joey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!</p>
                        <p>(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because 
                          Joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into 
                          the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This 
                          table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls 
                          on this table, he rides into the living room, with all 
                          the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls 
                          off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting 
                          as nothing happened. He is covered in food stains.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: My cranberries!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over 
                          me.</p>
                        <p>(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler 
                          a taste.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's 
                          gonna kill you!</p>
                        <p>(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... 
                          Look what... Look what the floating heads did!</p>
                        <p>Monica: (very emotional) I don't care.</p>
                        <p>(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks 
                          at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: What's going on?</p>
                        <p>Monica: That was the adoption agency...</p>
                        <p>Chandler: And?</p>
                        <p>Monica: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Are you serious? (they hug)</p>
                        <p>Monica: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked 
                          us!</p>
                        <p>(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in 
                          for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back 
                          a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: I'm so happy for you!</p>
                        <p>Monica: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's 
                          ass!</p>
                        <p>(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the 
                          food off his shirt)</p>
                        <p>COMMERCIAL BREAK</p>
                        <p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table 
                          is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're 
                          all there, toasting.]</p>
                        <p>Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked 
                          up girl in Ohio.</p>
                        <p>Ross: I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting 
                          a kid.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: I know. Have you considered pageanting?</p>
                        <p>Monica: I can't believe they called, and we're actually 
                          getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, I know how you feel...</p>
                        <p>(Monica and Chandler are looking curiously at Joey.)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Really?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Sure. I went through the exact same thing with 
                          Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then 
                          one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... 
                          She was in stock!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: That is the exact same thing.</p>
                        <p>THE END</p>
