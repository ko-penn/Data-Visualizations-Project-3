                        <p>Monica: Hey!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off 
                          to Ohio.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be 
                          carrying our baby.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, 
                          you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: And so incorrect!</p>
                        <p>Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She 
                          liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like 
                          us.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!</p>

                          to get our hopes up.</p>
                        <p>Monica: And a lot could still get in our way.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against 
                          adoption or she could like another couple better..</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: What are you gonna name the baby?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk 
                          and talk and no one hears a word.</p>
                        <p>Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? 
                          What if this woman does pick you guys?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting 
                          our hopes up'?</p>
                        <p>Monica: You know, I know that things could still go 
                          wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna 
                          have a baby Chandler, a baby!</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yes, but...</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make 
                          it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're 
                          gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm 
                          gonna get me... A BABY! (she leaves)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!</p>

                        <p>Phoebe: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any 
                          ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more 
                          of my friends!</p>
                        <p>Joey: OW, why, why, why?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her 
                          and then forget she exists!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that 
                          with.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Mandy.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: No.</p>
                        <p>Joey: I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks 
                          at Rachel)</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Do you think I'm someone else?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well 
                          in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, 
                          Rach?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey 
                          and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful 
                          and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he 
                          didn't sleep with anybody else!</p>
                        <p>Joey: (pointing at himself) Growth!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget 
                          this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: SARAH!</p>
                        <p>Joey: Saraaah.</p>

                          box and puts it on) How does this look?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... 
                          (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it 
                          up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There 
                          you go! (pause) Now throw it away!</p>
                        <p>Ross: C'mon! This looks good!</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines 
                          a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president 
                          or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have 
                          to get as far away as you can from that hat.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I 
                          have to look cool!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel 
                          and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than 
                          welcome to come with us, right?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to 
                          do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. 
                        </p>

                          had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...</p>

                          a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. 
                          And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh?

                          a child!”</p>
                        <p>Monica: Amen.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good 
                          hands with a doctor!</p>
                        <p>Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) 
                          Healing hands.</p>
                        <p>Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything 
                          about adoption?</p>
                        <p>Monica: It says "Do it!" And behold she did 
                          adopt unto them a baby. And it was good.</p>
                        <p>Erica: Wow.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, wow.</p>
                        <p>Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. 
                          (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby 
                          and your flock?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, 
                          my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this 
                          point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.</p>
                        <p>Erica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a 
                          lot of time.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Not for me it doesn’t.</p>
                        <p>(The agency guy enters the room)</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: So, how’s everything going in here?</p>
                        <p>Erica: We’re great, I think I may have asked 
                          all my questions.</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that 
                          you liked and you gave the agency the serial number 
                          and they contacted us?</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonymity. 
                          We’re very proud of it.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top 
                          of stuff..</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: (to Erica) Well, then if there’s 
                          nothing else, then the two of us should talk.</p>
                        <p>Erica: Actually, I don’t think we have to.</p>
                        <p>Monica: We don’t?</p>
                        <p>Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty 
                          sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet 
                          face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. 
                          I choose them.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! 
                          (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Yeah, I did.</p>
                        <p>Monica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. 
                          (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!</p>

                        <p>Rachel: We got some really great stuff!</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of 
                          the bra's I got.</p>
                        <p>Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on 
                          for me? </p>
                        <p>Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?</p>
                        <p>Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh 
                          no! I took one of Ross' bags by <br>
                          mistake, and one of mine is missing.</p>
                        <p>Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get 
                          it from him later.</p>

                          - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!</p>
                        <p>Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it 
                          out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? 
                          I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way 
                          over here.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't 
                          think you should be wearing that.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition 
                          with the ladies?</p>
                        <p>Joey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone 
                          IS the ladies!!</p>
                        <p>Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull 
                          this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up 
                          and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking 
                          out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey)

                          Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Why not?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think 
                          we're somebody else.</p>
                        <p>Monica: God works in mysterious ways.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You have gotta stop!</p>
                        <p>Monica: But she liked us.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like 
                          a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing 
                          the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what 
                          she just said)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34.95!</p>
                        <p>Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given 
                          an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been 
                          made. They are writing up the paper right now.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can 
                          you feel okay about this?</p>
                        <p>Monica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who 
                          she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby 
                          more than us.</p>

                          no one ever picks us?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: oh, honey..</p>
                        <p>Monica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so 
                          close.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman 
                          is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's 
                          going to. </p>

                          and then to Joey)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having 
                          instead.</p>
                        <p>Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.</p>
                        <p>Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm!</p>
                        <p>(Sarah's beeper starts bleeping)</p>
                        <p>Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can 
                          you excuse me?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.</p>
                        <p>(Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.)</p>
                        <p>Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share 
                          food.</p>
                        <p>Joey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?</p>
                        <p>Sarah: (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you 
                          can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (laughing) Really?</p>
                        <p>Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come 
                          back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs 
                          uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)</p>
                        <p>(Joey sits sideways on his chair, looking at Sarah's 
                          chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously 
                          playing with his fork, drumming with it on the table 
                          every now and then.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me!</p>
                        <p>(He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Why, just a tiny little...</p>
                        <p>(He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first 
                          he doesn't think it's that special, but then...)</p>
                        <p>Joey: Oh-oh!</p>
                        <p>TIME LAPSE</p>
                        <p>(Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees 
                          her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, 
                          and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: I'm not even sorry.</p>

                        <p>[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler 
                          are entering.]<br>
                          Erica: Hi!</p>
                        <p>Adoption Agency guy: Hey.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Hey.</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for 
                          an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll 
                          explain everything as we go through it.</p>
                        <p>Monica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... 
                          Is that a picture?</p>
                        <p>Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby 
                          last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives 
                          it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then 
                          shows it to Chandler)</p>
                        <p>Monica: Look, doctor!</p>
                        <p>(Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, 
                          before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) 
                          We're not who you think we are.</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: I don't understand.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My 
                          wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.</p>
                        <p>Erica: What?</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: That's impossible.</p>
                        <p>Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove 
                          it if you'd like.</p>
                        <p>Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me.</p>
                        <p>Erica: So who are you?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. 
                          We're from New York.</p>
                        <p>Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about 
                          us, is how much we would care for this little baby. 
                          (holds up the sonogram)</p>
                        <p>Erica: So you lied to me before?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) 
                          "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.</p>
                        <p>Erica: I can't believe this. </p>
                        <p>Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the 
                          truth that you still might consider...</p>
                        <p>Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my 
                          child after this?</p>
                        <p>Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but 
                          if you could just look at our file...</p>
                        <p>Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.</p>
                        <p>(She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. 
                          They meet in the hallway.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Erica wait!</p>
                        <p>Erica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did 
                          lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying 
                          to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long 
                          it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.</p>
                        <p>Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?</p>
                        <p>Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them 
                          to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef 
                          and I'm in advertising.</p>
                        <p>Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't 
                          matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away 
                          again, but Chandler catches up with her again)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's 
                          an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. 
                          And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always 
                          right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. 
                          And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... 
                          I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, 
                          I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's 
                          already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?</p>
                        <p>(They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. 
                          Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.)</p>
                        <p>Chandler: You still want that baby?</p>
                        <p>(Monica plays those words back in her mind and then 
                          smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. 
                          They hug.)</p>
                        <p>Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing!</p>

                          walks to him, with his jacket closed.]<br>
                          Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.</p>
                        <p>Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it?</p>
                        <p>Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Ooh... Not so good.</p>
                        <p>Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, 
                          huh old buddy?</p>
                        <p>Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.</p>
                        <p>(they shake hands the way friends would. There's a 
                          muffin on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and 
                          wants to put it in his mouth.)</p>
                        <p>Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!</p>
                        <p>(Ross puts the piece back on the plate)</p>
