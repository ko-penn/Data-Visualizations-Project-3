  I've been scared by that painting before. (Looks around) You know what this 
  whole place look familiar I have definitely been in this apartment I know I've 
  seen this weird plant before (it's a cactus and he touch's it) OUCH! It did 
  that the last time. Oh my god, I've gone out with this girl before yeah we had 
  sex on this couch and then on that chair and no. no we didn't do it hear which 
  is weird because it seems like a perfectly good place.</p>

  why.</p>

<p>Ross: I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.</p>
<p>Mike: Oh.</p>
<p>Ross: yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.</p>
<p>Mike: Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?</p>
<p>Ross: (laughs) No</p>
<p>Mike: oh it's just you have that look (shuts the front door)</p>
<p>Ross: Damn super cuts!</p>
<p>Mike: what's up is Phoebe ok?</p>
<p>Ross: oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before 
  you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.</p>
<p>Mike: that's why she was weird.</p>
<p>Ross: yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious 
  relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please 
  don't blow her off.</p>
<p>Mike: I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, 
  were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from 
  the coffee house.</p>
<p>Ross: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagen's 
  I bothered.</p>
<p>Mike: hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never 
  had a serious relationship?</p>
<p>Ross: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round 
  broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.</p>
<p>Mike: but you did say it</p>

  the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious 
  relationship with. Vicrum.</p>

  But you promised to love him no matter what.</p>
<p>Monica: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets 
  his jollys to jaws!</p>

<p>(Monica makes a strange face and sits down)</p>
<p>Rachel: so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're 
  just going around again.</p>
<p>Joey: well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping 
  with me.</p>
<p>Monica: But you don't remember sleeping with her.</p>
<p>Joey: yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you 
  guys know.</p>
<p>Rachel: what, how do we know, we never slept with you.</p>
<p>Joey: and who's fault is that.</p>
<p>Monica: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having 
  an off night</p>
<p>Joey: HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little 
  bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!</p>
<p>Monica: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.</p>
<p>Rachel: yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, 
  you're made for each other.</p>
<p>Joey: Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past 
  it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!</p>
<p>Monica: Joey, Joey.</p>
<p>Joey: What?</p>
<p>Monica: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?</p>
<p>Joey: No. (Pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?</p>
<p>(Monica just looks at him, and Rachel wants to laugh)</p>

  I went to talk to Mike.</p>
<p>Phoebe: What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!</p>
<p>Ross: oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great 
  you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.</p>
<p>Phoebe: WHAT!</p>
<p>Ross: umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.</p>
<p>Phoebe: WHAT! WHY?</p>
<p>Ross: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.</p>
<p>Phoebe: (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend 
  I swear to Lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>Ross: well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about 
  Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he used to date Oprah. 
  (He makes another wow face)</p>
<p>Phoebe: I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna 
  be honest with him.</p>
<p>Ross: Good yeah just be honest with him.</p>
<p>Phoebe: yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship 
  that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know 
  if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just 
  be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll 
  go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh (takes a deep breath and sits 
  down, knock on the door)</p>
<p>Ross: I'll get it</p>
<p>Phoebe: ok</p>
<p>Mike: (Ross opens the door) You know I'm trying to think of the last time I 
  opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok? (She has her hands over 
  her mouth)</p>
<p>Phoebe: Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm, there's something 
  you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.</p>
<p>[Scene: Joey is back at Hayley's place after there date]</p>
<p>Hayley: so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a 
  perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the 
  youngest.</p>
<p>Joey: Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?</p>
<p>Hayley: What?</p>
<p>Joey: How could you not remember that we slept together?</p>
<p>Hayley: What! When?</p>
<p>Joey: I dunno!</p>
<p>Hayley: I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you</p>
<p>Joey: come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was (thinks) a certain 
  amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out 
  the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?</p>
<p>Hayley: no it's not ringing any bells.</p>
<p>Joey: my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember 
  any of this?</p>
<p>Hayley's roommate: Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!</p>
<p>Joey: Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still 
  got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares at him) I'll let 
  myself out.</p>
<p>[Scene: Phoebe is sitting with Mike, explaining about Vicrum]</p>
<p>Phoebe: .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you 
  know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.</p>
<p>Mike: But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross</p>
<p>Phoebe: yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say 
  Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.</p>
<p>Mike: that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.</p>
<p>Phoebe: I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard 
  is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.</p>
<p>Mike: I just think there's somebody better out there for you, (pause) I mean 
  I'm not saying me but. maybe me.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Oh.</p>
<p>Mike: and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do 
  smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you 
  happy.</p>
<p>Phoebe: ok I can't do this.</p>
<p>Mike: what's wrong?</p>
<p>Phoebe: well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have 
  been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never 
  even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's too weird for you and you 
  wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward 
  (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her, Phoebe opens her eyes and 
  like a little child says.) You kissed me.</p>
<p>Mike: uh huh</p>
<p>Phoebe: so you don't think I'm a total freak</p>
<p>Mike: No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the 
  truth and also wanna kiss you.</p>
<p>Phoebe: I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also 
  wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm, 
  be a little concerned about the magic markers.</p>
<p>Mike: Definitely</p>
<p>Ross: (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it up, its Ross putting 
  on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.</p>
<p>[Scene: Chandler arrives home and Monica's got a video of Sharks ready for 
  Chandler]</p>
<p>Chandler: Hi honey I'm home!</p>
<p>Monica: Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)</p>
<p>Chandler: oh it was great.</p>
<p>Monica: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. (Monica 
  shows him the tape then puts it in) have a little surprise for you.</p>
<p>Chandler: well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock 
  IN NYC!</p>
<p>Monica: Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love you. (She presses 
  play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)</p>
<p>Chandler: (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks 
  swimming around.</p>
<p>Monica: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something 
  a little toothier.</p>
<p>Chandler: no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.</p>
<p>Monica: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they 
  did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?</p>
<p>Chandler: does what always have to be sharks.</p>
<p>Monica: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the 
  tub and thrash.</p>
<p>Chandler: What's going on?</p>
<p>Monica: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.</p>
<p>Chandler: let ME be a part of this!</p>
<p>Monica: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!</p>
<p>Chandler: no they don't</p>
<p>Monica: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.</p>
<p>Chandler: OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching 
  regular porn</p>
<p>Monica: really?</p>
<p>Chandler: yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.</p>
<p>Monica: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They hug)</p>
<p>Chandler: You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing 
  you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength 
  and understanding over something like that.</p>
<p>Monica: I'm very, very drunk right now.</p>
<p>(They hug, Scene fades to black)</p>
<p>[Scene: Phoebe is in central-perk with Joey telling him what Ross said to her 
  at the beginning]</p>
<p>Joey: (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my 
  confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her? </p>
<p>Phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. 
  Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have 
  never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless 
  experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern 
  into anything serious.</p>
<p>Joey: your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and speak to the girl and 
  he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with her.<br>
  end<br>
