                     I want to understand how important different characters are
                     when considering 1) the show as a whole and 2) a selected
                     season. How many episodes do they appear in overall? How
                     much do they speak in the show overall? (lines or dialogue,
                     or words could be used here). For the major characters, I
                     want to be able to see which episodes they they appear in
                     and which seasons. How much do they speak in these
                     episodes?

                  <sl-tab-panel name="character-wordclouds">
                     Option 1: What do characters say? Given a selected
                     character, create visual representations and interactions
                     that help me understand what they tend to say. For this
                     option, use an encoding designed for text data (such as a
                     word cloud or another representation we discuss in class).
                     You can add in additional views, like bar charts and line
                     charts, but I want to see at least one other encoding that
                     is designed for text data. I want to see what words do they
                     use most often, and how frequently they use them. Note-
                     you'll need to remove 'stem' words, (the, and, if,
                     was....), to get at the more interesting things they say.
                     Or you can focus on words that are unique to them- like
                     that they say more frequently than other characters. I want
                     to see if they have any sentences or phrases they say
                     frequently? For instance, if the show is Star Trek The Next
                     Generation, Captain Picard likely says 'Captain's Log.
                     Stardate' often. Or if it is Futurama, Prof. Farnsworth
                     says 'Good news, everyone!' Does what they say tend to
                     change from season to season? Allow me to select either the
                     whole show or a season and see what this character says for
                     the selection.
